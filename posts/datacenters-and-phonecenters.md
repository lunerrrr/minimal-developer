just think about what it represents:

it's a place that contains thousands of phones that had all the things that make them a phone removed but just enough so that android still considers them "the phone of a real person".

their only purpose is to give likes and fake traffic.

they literally only exist to "make number go up" and post fake comments. They create false interactions and waste electricity while doing so.
all to create the fake sense of attention and importance in a place where everything and everyone is fake.

at least data centers are honest about what they are.
